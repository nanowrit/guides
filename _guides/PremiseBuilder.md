## What is PremiseBuilder?
PremiseBuilder is a process you use to come up with a story idea. The process described here is similiar to what pulp fiction writers would use to come up with their story idea when they need to think of one fast that they could immediately sink their teeth into and churn it out. 

The trick is to write the premise in a way that motivates you, the author, to find out what happens next. It's written in a form that comprises two elements: 
 - The Dramatic Statement
 - The Dramatic Question

 You are probably quick familiar with this form. It is how many of the teasers for pulp fiction stories are written. But what is a dramatic statement and question? Let's look at that next.

## What is the Dramatic Statement
The dramatic statement is a short statement (one or two sentences) that establishes the focal character or protagonist of the story, the situation or the context of the story, and the objective of the protagonist in the story. 
 
## What is the Dramatic Question
The dramatic question also consists of one or two sentences that establish the antagonist or nemesis of the story, the disaster that looms if the protagonist fails, and the theme of the story or what the story is about.

## The Components of the Premise
### The Protagonist
The protagonist is the hero or heroine of the story. In classic pulp style, you could start with just a name but the name should forshadow the situation (which we will discuss next) and the character's personality or essence.

Old pulp fiction writers used to keep lists of names they could use for characters when they couldn't think of one off the top of their head. If you can't think of a name right now, just use the space to describe the protagonist for now. 

While you are going on with your daily life, you may find that you think of some great character names. Just add that to the space available as well. Once you have the name and a great description of your story you have met your protagonist. 
### The Situation
The situation is the context of the story. Are there zombies? Are there robots? Are there zombie robots?! These are all part of the context or situation and would go into the space provided for the situation. An example from a story most are familiar with would look something like this:
> "All of humanity experiences life in a simulation while AI robots use live human bodies as a source of bioelectrical energy."  
--The Matrix

Now that you have a context for the world of your story, let's figure out what your protagonist wants in this crazy world by determining the objective next.

### The Objective
The objective is the protagonist's goal in the story--it is what they want and ultimately is the source of conflict in the story driving it through dramatic twists and turns until arriving at the climax. 

The objective is best determined by understanding the theme of the story. We'll cover the theme shortly but for now that the secret to the protagonist's accomplishing the objective lies in the theme. They must either accept or reject the key element of the theme in order to overcome the challenges they face in the story.

The source of those challenges largely originate from the opponent or nemesis of the story. Let's get a look at this character next. 
### The Opponent
The opponent is the resistance that the focal character experiences in their quest to obtain their objective. This can be another individual, a group of individuals, or even an aspect of the protagonist themselves or even some dark aspect of their objective. Your story may even see the opposition as the nature of the world described in the situation.

Its often helpful to remember that the opponent is the source of conflict for the protagonist. Its also helpful to remember that conflict can originate from three different dimensions. These can are often described as (1) Man-vs-Man, (2) Man-vs-Nature, and (3) Man-vs-Self.

If you are struggling with coming up with a description for the Opponent, try thinking along these three dimensions and look at your Situation and Protagonist and just imagine ways to make their life hell. Eventually something you come up with will sound interesting enough to you that you want to know what happens. 

If the protagonist, situation, and objective are just right, you will have put your protagonist in a place where failure is just not an option. The disaster that would result from failure is something that your protagonist is willing to avoid at all costs. Let's look at the disaster next.
