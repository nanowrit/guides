      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to develop applications that help the fiction writer work through the entire fiction writing process without having to mull over what to do next. Our inspiration comes from classic pulp fiction writers of the early 20th century. Many of these classic pulp fiction writers had developed writing processes that would allow them to produce "sellable" work no matter how they were feeling creatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps inspired by John Milton Edwards' <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47455">The Fiction Factory</a>, classic pulp fiction writers had a form of mass production they would employ to consistently produce sellable work to keep their careers going despite the sometimes elusive nature of their muse.
      </p>
      <h3>Tools of the Trade</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h4>PremiseBuilder</h4>
      <p>
        The process of writing fiction starts with the generation of an idea for a story. It also involves architecting a story structure as well as obviously writing the story. One of our solutions for helping writers come up with story ideas is called PremiseBuilder.

      <h4>SceneBuilder</h4>
      <p>
        Stories that would consistently sell would have an often recognizable structure. One of our solutions for adding a structure to your premise is called SceneBuilder.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design of SceneBuilder will also help the aspiring author to step away from the drafting table of the story structure architect and get their hands dirty laying the bricks and pouring the concrete necessary to make the story real. Something publishable. After a few drafts, edits and re-writes that is.

      <p>
        The purpose of all this is to make writing more fun. More like a game, less like climbing Mount Everest or anything else that feels as daunting as staring at a blank file after you decided you were finally going to do it. You were going to write that novel. It is the question that comes up at that moment, we hope to address. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are looking at that blank page, we don't want anyone to wonder, "What do I do know?" because you will know what to do. After a while it is our hope that you have our processes internalized and you have even modified them to make them your own or improved on what we have done.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Hope</h2>
      <p>
        Our hope is that you will find success in your dreams of being a writer. That you will come to find a writing process that you find comfortable and that allows you to produce consistent, enjoyable stories. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What you do with these stories is up to you. You could publish them, share them with friends, family, and those you are close to. If you would like to workshop a story you have created in Nanowrit Labs or elsewhere, please post it in our <a href="https://workshop.nanowritlabs.com/c/workshopping/">workshop</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or you could put them away and never think about them again because our ultimate hope is to provide anyone with an enjoyable writing experience that will introduce you to the innate and vast capacity for creativity that we all possess as human beings. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also our hope that, if you have discovered something that could make our solutions better, you let us know by creating an issue <a href="https://github.com/nanowrit/guides/issues">in github</a> or start a new topic <a href="https://workshop.nanowritlabs.com/c/feature-requests/">in our forum</a>. This is also where you can make feature requests if you would like to see a solution developed that hasn't been developed yet.
